  title={Hybridcr: Weakly-supervised 3d point cloud semantic segmentation via hybrid contrastive regularization},
  author={Li, Mengtian and Xie, Yuan and Shen, Yunhang and Ke, Bo and Qiao, Ruizhi and Ren, Bo and Lin, Shaohui and Ma, Lizhuang},
  abstract={To address the huge labeling cost in large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation, we propose a novel hybrid contrastive regularization (HybridCR) framework in weakly-supervised setting, which obtains competitive performance compared to its fully-supervised counterpart. Specifically, HybridCR is the first framework to leverage both point consistency and employ contrastive regularization with pseudo labeling in an end-to-end manner. Fundamentally, HybridCR explicitly and effectively considers the semantic similarity between local neighboring points and global characteristics of 3D classes. We further design a dynamic point cloud augmentor to generate diversity and robust sample views, whose transformation parameter is jointly optimized with model training. Through extensive experiments, HybridCR achieves significant performance improvement against the SOTA methods on both indoor and outdoor datasets, e.g., S3DIS, ScanNet-V2, Semantic3D, and SemanticKITTI.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
